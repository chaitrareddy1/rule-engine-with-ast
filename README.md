# Rule Engine with AST

## Project Overview

The **Rule Engine with AST** is a web-based application that allows users to create, combine, and evaluate conditional rules based on user attributes like age, department, and income. The system builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent each rule and allows flexibility for future updates, combination, and evaluation.

### Features
- **Rule Creation**: Input simple or complex conditions to define eligibility rules.
- **Rule Combination**: Merge multiple rules into a single logical structure.
- **Rule Evaluation**: Check if given user data meets the conditions specified by combined rules.
- **Database Persistence**: Rules and AST structures are stored in an SQLite database.

---

## Project Structure
- **Frontend**: A simple UI built with HTML and JavaScript.
- **Backend**: Flask-based API for handling rule logic.
- **Database**: SQLite for rule persistence.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rule-engine-ast.git
   cd rule-engine-ast
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure Python and Flask are installed, then install the required packages.
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

3. **Database Setup**:
   Initialize the SQLite database by running the schema file:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 rule_engine.db < schema.sql
   ```

4. **Start the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the Frontend**:
   Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## API Endpoints

1. **POST /create_rule**
   - **Description**: Create and store a new rule.
   - **Body**: `{ "rule": "<rule_string>" }`
   - **Response**: `{"message": "Rule created successfully", "rule": "<rule_string>"}`

2. **POST /combine_rules**
   - **Description**: Combine all stored rules into a single AST.
   - **Response**: `{ "combined_rule": "<combined_ast_structure>" }`

3. **POST /evaluate_rule**
   - **Description**: Evaluate a combined rule against provided user data.
   - **Body**: `{ "data": { "age": 30, "department": "Sales" } }`
   - **Response**: `{"result": true/false}`

---

## Non-Functional Considerations

- **Security**:
  - **Input Validation**: Prevent SQL injection and validate inputs before rule creation.
  - **API Authentication**: Consider securing endpoints with authentication for production.

- **Performance**:
  - **Caching**: Frequently evaluated rules are cached in memory.
  - **Database Optimization**: Indexes are added to optimize rule retrieval.

- **Maintainability**:
  - **Modular Code**: Each module handles rule creation, combination, or evaluation.
  - **Error Handling**: Logging errors to help track invalid rules or format issues.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Conditions**: Add support for complex user-defined functions.
- **UI Enhancements**: Visualize rule flow and structure for better user experience.
